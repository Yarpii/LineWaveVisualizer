# LineWaveVisualizer

### 🎵 Real-Time Line-Based Sound Visualizer
**LineWaveVisualizer** is an interactive OpenGL-based sound visualization tool that generates animated **waveforms and grid patterns** in response to real-time audio input.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎶 **Audio-Driven Line Visualization** – Waveforms and grid effects react dynamically to sound properties.
- 🎛 **Real-Time Controls** – Modify amplitude, frequency, stereo pan, and sound filtering with keyboard input.
- 🎨 **Customizable Colors & Effects** – Cycle through different color presets for a unique experience.
- 🔊 **Multiple Sound Waveforms** – Choose between sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, and noise.
- 🎼 **Chords & Scales Support** – Generate musical chords and different scales dynamically.
- 🎥 **Interactive Camera & Views** – Toggle between top-down and perspective views.

## 🖥️ Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python** and the required dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy scipy
```

## ▶️ Running the Visualizer
Simply execute the Python script:
```sh
python sound.py
```
